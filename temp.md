INFO:__main__:Processed response from llama16e API : The encoder in the given picture consists of the following components:

*   **Input Embedding**: This is where the input data is embedded into a higher-dimensional space.
*   **Positional Encoding**: This adds positional information to the input embeddings, allowing the model to understand the order of the input sequence.
*   **Nx Encoder Layers**: The encoder consists of a stack of identical layers, each comprising:
    *   **Multi-Head Attention**: This mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance.
    *   **Add & Norm**: This is a residual connection that adds the output of the multi-head attention mechanism to the input, followed by layer normalization.
    *   **Feed Forward**: This is a fully connected feed-forward network that transforms the output of the multi-head attention mechanism.

The encoder takes in a sequence of tokens (e.g., words or characters) and outputs a sequence of vectors, which are then used as input to the decoder. The encoder is responsible for capturing the context and relationships between the input tokens.

In this case, there are **Nx** encoder layers, where **Nx** represents the number of layers in the encoder.]

**Encoder Architecture:**

*   The encoder is represented by the left-hand side of the diagram, enclosed within a brown dashed box labeled "ENCODER."
*   It consists of a series of identical layers, denoted by "Nx," where N is the number of layers.
*   Each layer comprises two sub-layers:
    *   **Multi-Head Attention:** This sub-layer is responsible for capturing complex relationships between different parts of the input sequence.
    *   **Feed Forward:** This sub-layer applies a fully connected feed-forward network to the output of the multi-head attention mechanism.
*   Both sub-layers are followed by **Add & Norm** operations, which involve adding the input to the output of the sub-layer and then applying layer normalization.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Input Embedding:** The input sequence is first embedded into a higher-dimensional space using an embedding layer.
2.  **Positional Encoding:** The embedded input is then added to positional encoding, which provides information about the position of each token in the sequence.
3.  **Nx Layers:** The encoded input is passed through N identical layers, each consisting of the two sub-layers mentioned earlier.

**In Summary:** The encoder in the picture is the left-hand side component, which takes the input sequence, embeds it, adds positional encoding, and then passes it through N identical layers, each comprising multi-head attention and feed-forward sub-layers, followed by add & norm operations.
